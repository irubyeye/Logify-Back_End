# logify_courseWork

    Developed an API following the REST principles and MVC architecture for a ridesharing delivery service. The project utilizes the Node.js platform with the Express framework, MongoDB as the database, and Mongoose ODM for interacting with it. I have designed the database model and implemented the entire business logic of the product.

    The API incorporates essential features such as filters, sorting, and pagination, providing users with efficient search and retrieval capabilities. Furthermore, I have implemented a robust authentication system that issues unique bearer tokens. This authentication system leverages the JWT library for token generation and bcrypt for password hashing, ensuring the security of the system.

    By adhering to the best practices of REST and employing the MVC architecture, the API achieves a high level of modularity, separation of concerns, and scalability. The Node.js and Express combination offers a lightweight and efficient platform for building fast and reliable web applications. The choice of MongoDB as the database enables seamless handling of unstructured data, facilitating flexibility and scalability in the storage layer.

    Throughout the development process, I have prioritized code readability, maintainability, and adherence to industry standards. By following the established conventions and leveraging well-known libraries, I have ensured that the codebase remains clean, organized, and easily extensible.
